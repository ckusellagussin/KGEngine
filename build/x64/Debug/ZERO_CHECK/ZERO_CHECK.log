  Checking Build System
  CMake is re-running because C:/GameEngine/KGEngine/build/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp is out-of-date.
    the file 'C:/GameEngine/KGEngine/CMakeLists.txt'
    is newer than 'C:/GameEngine/KGEngine/build/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp.depend'
    result='-1'
  CMake Warning (dev) at C:/Users/Casey/Documents/Dependencies/vcpkg/installed/x64-windows/share/glfw3/glfw3Targets.cmake:53 (add_library):
    ADD_LIBRARY called with SHARED option but the target platform does not
    support dynamic linking.  Building a STATIC library instead.  This may lead
    to problems.
  Call Stack (most recent call first):
    C:/Users/Casey/Documents/Dependencies/vcpkg/installed/x64-windows/share/glfw3/glfw3Config.cmake:1 (include)
    CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package)
